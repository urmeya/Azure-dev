# Python Azure Function App using the V2 programming model with decorators

Developing locally with the Azure Functions Core Tools is the most efficient way to handle this, as it provides a robust local development and debugging environment that is not available directly on the Azure portal. You will use the portal for creating the resource and for monitoring your app after deployment.


## Step-by-Step Plan
### 1. Set up your Local Development Environment

Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or a later version installed.

Install Azure Functions Core Tools: This is a crucial command-line tool for creating, running, and managing your function apps. Install it by following the official documentation.

Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code): This is the recommended IDE for Azure Functions development. Install the "Azure Functions" extension from the marketplace.

Install the Azure CLI: This tool will be used for logging in to Azure and managing your resources from the command line.

### 2. Create a Local Azure Functions Project

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Create a new project folder and navigate into it.

Run the command `func init --worker-runtime python --docker` to create a new function app project with a Dockerfile, which you'll need for containerization.

### 3. Implement the Python Code

Inside your project directory, you will find a file named `function_app.py`. This is where you will add all your code. I have provided the complete code below that fulfills all your requirements, including function triggers, a processor registry, base processor interface, health checks, logging, and error handling.

### 4. Run and Test Locally

Once you have the code in `function_app.py`, install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The code uses azure-functions. You will also need to add any other required packages to this file if you need them.

Start the function app locally by running the command func start.

The function will expose a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7071/api/process_data`). You can use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request with your JSON payload to this URL and test the logic.

### 5. Containerize the Function App

The `func init` command already created a Dockerfile for you.

To build the Docker image, run `docker build -t your-image-name .` from your project directory.

To test the containerized app locally, run it with `docker run -p 80:80 your-image-name`.

### 6. Deploy to Azure

Create a Function App in the Azure Portal:

Log in to the Azure portal and select "Create a resource".

Search for "Function App" and create a new one.

Fill out the details:

Publish: Choose "Docker Container".

Operating System: Select "Linux".

Region: Select a region close to you.

Plan: Choose a hosting plan (e.g., Consumption Plan for serverless, or Premium for more advanced features like VNet integration and dedicated instances).

Push the Container Image:

You need a container registry (like Azure Container Registry). If you don't have one, create it.

Log in to your registry from the command line: az acr login --name your-registry-name.

Tag your local Docker image with the registry URL: docker tag your-image-name your-registry-name.azurecr.io/your-image-name:v1.

Push the image: docker push your-registry-name.azurecr.io/your-image-name:v1.

Configure the Function App:

In the Azure portal, navigate to your new Function App.

Under "Deployment Center", link your Function App to the container image you just pushed. This will deploy your containerized app.

## Code details

As your function app grows, modularizing the code makes it far easier to maintain, test, and scale. We'll use standard Python package structure to split the core logic into a processors directory.

Here is the detailed, modularized implementation broken down into five files.

### 1. File Structure Overview
We will create a root directory for the Function App and a subdirectory named processors/.
```
<project_root>/
├── function_app.py          # Main Azure Function entry points
├── requirements.txt         # Required Python packages
└── processors/
    ├── __init__.py          # Imports all processors to register them
    ├── base_processor.py    # Base interface and centralized registry
    └── downstream_app_1.py  # Specific processor implementation
```
### 2. Code Files Details
- Isolation (Separation of Concerns): The `BaseProcessor` and `ProcessorRegistry` are isolated in `processors/base_processor.py`. They define the contract and the routing mechanism, but no actual processing logic.

- Self-Registration: When Python imports processors, the `processors/__init__.py` file runs. This file explicitly imports `downstream_app_1.py`. When `downstream_app_1.py` is imported, the registration line at the bottom (ProcessorRegistry.register_processor(...)) is executed, making the processor instantly available in the central registry.

- Clean Entry Point: The main function in function_app.py only needs to import the registry, look up the required processor by name (from the request header/query), and call its generic process() method. It doesn't need to know the specific class name (`DownstreamAppProcessor`).

- Scalability: To add a new downstream application, you simply create a new file (e.g., `processors/downstream_app_2.py`), define the new class that implements `BaseProcessor`, and add its import line to `processors/__init__.py`. The `function_app.py` file never needs to be modified.

- `function_app.py` file acts as the main handler for your Azure Function, responsible for receiving the HTTP request and routing it to the appropriate, modularized processor using the `ProcessorRegistry`.
